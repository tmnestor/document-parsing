"""Parameter resolution for layout primitives.

Resolution order is block key -> the layout's `defaults:` -> fail fast. There is
deliberately no fourth step: a Python literal supplying a value YAML omitted is
exactly what CLAUDE.md's "every config key is required" rule forbids, and it is
how `role`, `color`, `align` and 28 other pixel decisions came to live in Python
rather than in the layout files.

    """Resolve one primitive parameter.

    Resolution order is `block[block_key]` -> `layout["defaults"][key]` -> fail
    fast. `key` and `block_key` are the same string in the common case, and
    `block_key` may be omitted -- they diverge only where `PARAMETER_DEFAULTS`
    namespaces a key a primitive shares with another. A panel's own YAML key is
    still `padding:`, but its default lives under `panel_padding` in the
    layout's flat `defaults:` namespace, since a bare `padding` default could
    not carry two different primitives' defaults at once; banner's own key is
    still `role:`, but its default lives under `banner_role`, since a bare
    `role` default could not simultaneously be "body" for text/pair/block and
    "header" for banner. Passing only `key` in these cases would silently drop
    every per-block override under the short name: the block's own YAML key
    never renames itself to match the namespaced default, so `block.get(key)`
    would never find it and would fall straight through to the shared default
    -- exactly the bug this argument exists to prevent.

    Args:
        block: The block dict, whose own `block_key` wins if present.
        layout: The resolved layout dict, carrying a `defaults:` mapping.
        key: The parameter name in `PARAMETER_DEFAULTS`, e.g. "color" or
            "panel_padding" -- looked up against `layout["defaults"]`.
        layout_id: Layout id, used in the diagnostic.
        layout_path: Path to the layout YAML, used in the diagnostic.
        block_key: The block's own literal YAML key for this value, if it
            differs from `key`. Defaults to `key` itself.

    Returns:
        The block's value if it carries `block_key`, otherwise the layout
        default for `key`. Typed `Any`, not `object`: this resolves
        heterogeneous YAML values (str, int, bool, list) that every caller
        immediately casts to the concrete type it needs (`int(...)`,
        `bool(...)`, `str(...)`) -- `object` buys no real type safety here
        (a caller's own cast is what actually enforces the type) and only
        forces every call site to route the result through an extra
        `Any`-typed local variable first, since `object` alone does not
        satisfy `int()`'s overloads.

    Raises:
        DefaultsError: If neither supplies a value.
